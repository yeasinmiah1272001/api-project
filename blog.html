                            Discuss the scope of var, let, and const

                     <div class="collapse-content"> 
                       <p>var has function or global scope, allowing access within functions or globally. let and const have block scope, limiting access to the block where they're defined. However, let allows reassignment, while const is for immutable values. Choose var cautiously due to potential global scope issues. Use let when variable reassignment is needed and const for constants to prevent unintentional changes. Properly understanding the scope of these keywords is vital for writing maintainable and predictable JavaScript code.</p>

                            Tell us the use cases of null and undefined

                     <div class="collapse-content"> 
                       <p>null is explicitly assigned to represent the absence of a value, often used to indicate intentional absence or reset. undefined is the default value when a variable is declared but not assigned. Use null when you want to indicate the intentional absence of value, and undefined when a variable lacks a value due to not being assigned. Both play roles in managing data flow and handling conditions in JavaScript programs.</p>
